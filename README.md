# FasterRCNN

In  this  project  we  implemented  some  of  the  components  of  MaskRCNN,  an  algorithm  that 
addresses  the  task  of  instance  seg-mentation,  which  combines  object  detection  and  semantic
segmentation into a per-pixel object detection framework.

Part A: Implemented  a  Region  Proposal  Network  (RPN) 
Part B: Implemented and trained the object detection heads using classifier and regression losses using a pretrained RPN network
